                A: "Hi Mark."<br>B: "Oh, hi Stacy."<br>A: "How was your summer vacation?"<br>B: "I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money right? What did you do?"<br>A: "I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up."<br>B: "So are you officially a junior now?"<br>A: "Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same."<br>B: "That makes sense. So where is Nicole?"<br>A: "She dropped out of school completely."<br>B: "Really? Why?"<br>A: "She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time."<br>B: "Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job."<br>A: "It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer."<br>B: "Do you know how much they are paying her?"<br>A: "I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn't have accepted it."
