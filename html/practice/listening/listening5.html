                A: "Hey Samantha. You've been so busy lately. What have you been up to?"<br>B: "Hey Jackie. I started dating this cute guy and decided to start exercising."<br>A: "You're not out of shape. You look fine."<br>B: "Well, this guy I am seeing is a personal trainer and he has a perfect body. Compared to him, I need some work."<br>A: "How long have you seen him?"<br>B: "We've been together for about a month and a half."<br>A: "Did you sleep with him yet?"<br>B: "Not yet. But before I get into bed with him, I want to look fit."<br>A: "That's not the greatest reason to exercise, but I guess it is a valid one."<br>B: "How about you? Anything new in your life?"<br>A: "My father is a little ill. He has been to the doctor's quite a bit lately but they don't know what is wrong with him. He complains about stomach pains a lot these days."<br>B: "I'm sorry to hear that. Any idea what could have caused it?"<br>A: "He says it is because he didn't take care of himself when he was young. That's why I want to start thinking about my health."<br>B: "I think it is important to take care of yourself while you are young too. Even though my reasons are not the best, at least I am working on it."<br>A: "How are your parents doing?"<br>B: "They're doing great. I'm thankful that they are healthy."<br>A: "That's good to hear. Well, I gotta get running now. I'll catch you later."<br>B: "Ok. Send my regards to your father."<br>A: "I will. Thanks."
